Reproduce (Key_Feature variant): pushed in via push-slide LEFT from Frame 2. Cursor performs one concrete edit (drag), camera stays locked (the drag itself is the "chase"), lands on the outcome (ring).

Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): the 3-column board is already present (push-slide carries it in); the cursor enters and grips the "Onboarding redirect fix" card in Backlog as the VO says "Plan the cycle in seconds" — card lifts slightly (cursor-drag start).
Scene 2 (1.8–4.2s): as the VO says "drag an issue into place," the cursor drags the ghosted card rightward from Backlog into This Cycle, other cards in that column making room (reflow); card drop-snaps into its new slot with a small spring-pop.
Scene 3 (4.2–6.983s): as the VO finishes "watch the whole sprint shift to match it," the progress ring lower-right sweeps from empty to partial fill in sync with the drop; hold on the settled board + filled ring through the padded tail; the one-line caption fades in bottom-band.

narrativeRole: First proof beat — a concrete workflow moment that makes "fast and focused" tangible.
keyMessage: Planning work is a drag-and-drop, not a meeting.

## Selected blueprint: cursor-ui-demo

# cursor-ui-demo — Cursor-Driven UI Demo

**intent**: A visible custom cursor drives a real (reconstructed) app UI through clicks / hovers / drags so the screen changes state shot-to-shot, while the camera chases each interaction — the product surface is the subject and the cursor is the actor.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-cursor-ui-demo`): first look at the product surface — the cursor sweeps/hovers to \_introduce\* the app and reveal what it is, landing on a hovered hero element or freshly-popped result. Light, exploratory; backdrop steps colors as it goes.
- Key_Feature (from `key-feature-cursor-ui-demo`): one specific multi-step workflow demonstrated \_end-to-end\* (edit / configure / select across 2–4 discrete beats), each beat a real edit the UI responds to live, landing locked on the primary action button or the produced result.
- Key_Feature (from `workflow-approve-press`): an agency / confirmation workflow framed by a cockpit of 3D-tilted flanks — a step list ticks pending → active → complete (a snap state machine, CSS responding to `[data-state]`), and a flank button takes the PRESS as the payoff (its color flips to success, a checkmark stamps). The click is the climax, not a passing gesture.
- Key_Feature (from `cursor-app-state-tour`): the static-stage STATE TOUR — the cursor drives a reconstructed app through 2–4 discrete feature states on a LOCKED frame; every scene change is a click-triggered element swap/scale (modal springs from center, side panel slides in from the right edge, settings hard-swap, table populates, node-graph builds), never a real camera move; optional `[title card]` Scene 0 in front and a `[brand end beat]` behind.
- Key_Feature (from `drag-field-onto-document`): the DRAG-DROP journey — one continuous zoom-breathing shot of a document workspace: the cursor drags a ghosted `[field chip]` from an inputs sidebar onto the page, drop-snaps it into a placed field, a modal/typing beat completes it, and the placed element is adjusted in close-up before the cursor heads to the `[Finish/CTA]`.
- Product_Intro: the low-event BROWSE — the cursor roams ONE clean page state and the filter controls answer with slight hover updates; no typed input, no title beats, and the shot may end mid-roam.
- Product_Intro (from `hover-inspect-run`): the HOVER-INSPECT run — a click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms out from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` while a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, outline-highlighting and content-snapping per hovered element. (The slice's three-beat dark title prelude, scenes 1–3, belongs to `titlecard-reveal`, not here.)
- Hook: the ambient MULTI-CURSOR canvas — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` work a design canvas simultaneously (grab-drag-drop of components between mockups, recolor/identity swaps on drop) while the canvas group translate-PANS within a static frame and a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the demo; the live workshop itself is the hook. One continuous beat, no cuts, no camera.
- Benefits (from `ui-demo-text-interlude-ui-demo`): the demo|text|demo SANDWICH — two static-stage demo beats of this blueprint bridge through a full-screen kinetic/title interlude and back (cursor acts, UI answers, all "zoom" element scale); the interlude beat is `kinetic-type-beats` material, and the sandwich itself is sequencing above the single-shot unit.

**duration**: 4.0–12.9s (Key_Feature 4.0–12.9s — the mined state tours run long, 10.4–12.9s, and the drag-drop journeys 9.8–10.6s, against the original 4.0–7.3s set; Product_Intro 4.5–9.3s — the low-event browse sets the 4.5s floor; Hook ~6.5s; the Benefits demo|text|demo sandwich totals 11.6–12.8s with each demo half ~4–5s)

**shot structure** (a `[product UI surface]` — fixed app window, dashboard/editor, parallax `[content card]` stack, or a `[container object/icon]` — centered over `[bg color/gradient]`, shown `[flat]` or `[3D-isometric]`; a custom `[brand-colored cursor with icon]` is the protagonist and the camera servos to whatever it touches; UI responds _live_ and in sync with each cursor action. Two role-tuned tempos fold in — Product_Intro **sweeps to introduce**, Key_Feature **performs a workflow** — and the camera spans a spectrum: the full CHASE, one continuous zoom-breathe, or a fully LOCKED static stage where the UI itself does all the moving.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~Xs) — surface establishes + first touch.** The `[product UI surface]` arrives centered over `[bg color/gradient]` — either it is simply present (fixed window / dashboard / editor), a 3D-parallax stack of `[content cards]`, or a `[container object/icon]` that FLIES IN with a 3D tumble and settles. The custom `[cursor]` enters. The cursor performs the FIRST action on `[cursor target 1]` and the UI responds live in the same beat. Camera holds or begins a slow push-in toward the acted-on region.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: low-commitment first touch — cursor HOVERS/sweeps a control or SWEEP-HIGHLIGHTS a field to `[accent color]`, OR the `[container]` fans open. An optional label/title fades/morphs onto the surface. The point is to _show the surface exists_ and is touchable.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: a concrete edit — cursor DRAGS a scrollbar / TYPES into a field / DRAGS a handle, and the UI responds materially (`[scroll]` / value climbs / region resizes). If the surface opened in `[3D-isometric]`, it may snap perspective-FLAT here to read the workflow.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: an optional Scene 0 — `[title card / kinetic brand word]` on a flat field — hard-cuts or window-SCALES-UP into the surface; the `[app UI]` is fully present from the first frame and the cursor enters and glides to the first control. The camera is LOCKED from the start and stays locked.
  - _Variant — Hook (ambient multi-cursor)_: no single protagonist — several labeled `[teammate cursors]` are already at work across `[N mockups]` on a design canvas; the canvas group translate-PANS within the static frame while a `[headline]` builds word-group by word-group over the top. One continuous beat, no cuts.

- **Scene 2 (~Xs–~Ys) — camera chases to the next interaction (the engine).** The camera MOVES to the next target — push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to `[cursor target k]` — and the cursor performs action k as the UI updates live. Each beat is a discrete interaction connected by a fast camera move; the surface's inner content SWAPS per interaction.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: navigation is exploratory — a slow camera pan + depth-of-field FOCUS-PULL across a parallax `[content card]` stack, or the `[container]` fanning into `[N option/content cards]` that SPRING to position. As content swaps, the supporting backdrop STEPS its color (`[bg step 1]` → step 2 → …). Typically one or two such moves.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: repeat for `[2–4 beats total]`, each a distinct operation the UI answers — counter COUNTS UP, `[pill/swatch]` SELECTS, a modal SLIDES UP and TYPES — connected by whip-pans / progressive zoom. The workflow visibly advances toward a result.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: the camera never moves — every beat is a click-triggered ELEMENT response: a modal SPRINGS/scales up from center, a `[side detail panel]` SLIDES in from the right edge (a second panel may slide over the first), hamburger→sidebar slide-open, a settings panel HARD-swaps its content, a dropdown fills, a `[table]` populates row-by-row, a formula types into a cell and the range populates on enter, a type-to-filter list live-collapses, a `[block]` pops into the canvas, a node-graph BUILDS (cards + connecting lines radiate from center), a hover drops a `[popover]` below a tag. Any "zoom" is element scale of the UI only.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: the cursor GRABS a `[field chip]` from an `[inputs sidebar]`, drags a semi-transparent GHOST across the page, and drops it — it SNAPS into a placed field with bounding box + corner handles; a completion beat follows (a `[modal]` springs up over the dimmed document, a name types letter-by-letter while a live `[cursive preview]` builds per keystroke, confirm click). The whole clip rides one continuous zoom-BREATHING arc (slow zoom-out / gentle zoom-in / final zoom-out) instead of discrete camera beats.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (hover-inspect)_: the cursor's first click SPAWNS a labeled `[toolbar]`, the camera zooms OUT from a tight crop to the full page, then the cursor sweeps `[page elements]` — each hovered element gets an outline and a floating `[inspector panel]` TRACKS the cursor, its content snapping per element.

- **Scene 3 (~Ys–end) — payoff state, camera settles, HOLD.** The cursor lands on its final target and the screen reaches the payoff state; the camera comes to rest (static) and holds.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the cursor HOVERS the hero element — a `[content card]` SCALES UP on hover, a node gets an `[Available]`-style pill, or a `[result card]` POPS/springs in — the "here's the product" payoff. Settles static, holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: locked close-up on the OUTCOME — cursor lands on the `[primary action button: Export / Save / Reimburse]` and a `[hover backdrop / highlight]` SPRING-pops in (the climax is the action button / produced result). Holds.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (static-stage tour)_: optional detachable end beat — `[brand text beat / icon-ring lockup / end stat card]` — or the cursor simply comes to REST on the next target and holds (006_claudeai ends with the cursor on a panel's close X, the panel never closing).
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (drag-drop)_: close-up on the placed element ADJUSTED — a corner-handle drag proportionally resizes it — then the cursor sweeps toward the `[Finish / CTA]` as the clip ends.
  - _Variant — browse / hover-inspect_: no payoff lock at all — the shot ends MID-demo, cursor still roaming (browse and hover-inspect modes).

**rule mapping**

- viewport follows the cursor / camera servos to whatever it touches (primary) → `camera-cursor-tracking`
- cursor moves to a target, presses, emits a ripple (the click itself — primary interaction primitive) → `cursor-click-ripple`
- screen-state swap shot-to-shot (surface inner content changes between beats) → `scale-swap-transition`
- camera push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down to the next target → `viewport-change` (pan/zoom across the UI)
- sequencing the chase into discrete interaction beats → `multi-phase-camera`
- zoom onto the specific acted-on UI region → `coordinate-target-zoom`
- cursor icon/state changing with context (e.g. pointer↔grab over a draggable handle) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- which content appears per beat / step-by-step UI state progression / per-interaction swaps → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- sweep-highlight a field, highlight a UI keyword to `[accent color]` → `asr-keyword-glow` (keyword glow on the touched element)
- clicked button compresses on press, springs back on release → `press-release-spring`
- cursor + button compress together on a heavier press → `physics-press-reaction`
- panel/card morphs between two states (e.g. card → expanded card, surface state A → B) → `card-morph-anchor`
- terminal hover-scale, `[result card]` pop-in, spring hover-backdrop on the final action button → `spring-pop-entrance`
- card fan-out to corners / option cards springing to position → `split-tilt-cards` (fan/spread into tilted positions) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the spring settle)
- 3D-parallax content-card stack as the surface; UI shown 3D-isometric → `3d-page-scroll` (UI as a tilted scrolling/parallax card)
- node gets an `[Available]`-style pill / tracked badge appears on an element → `ai-tracking-box`
- counter / value count-up as the UI responds → `counting-dynamic-scale`
- a result bar / number FILLS as the workflow's outcome → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- a live `[video]` screen-capture clip used as the surface → technique: video compositing
- perspective-flatten (3D-isometric → flat 2D snap) and the 3D-isometric tilt itself → technique: CSS-3D (no dedicated rule; the tilt/flatten transform is a CSS-3D primitive)
- camera settles static on the payoff and HOLDS → (settle phase of `spring-pop-entrance` on the payoff element; the static hold itself needs no rule)
- 3D container/object fly-in & tumble-settle → `depth-scatter-assemble` (free-tumbling 3D object/container entrance that flies in and tumble-settles; `orbit-3d-entry` only orbits a flat element into place)
- depth-of-field focus-pull across the parallax card stack → `depth-of-field-blur` (rack-focus / DoF blur transition between near and far cards; `3d-page-scroll` supplies the tilted parallax stack and `viewport-change` the pan)
- paginated/stepped backdrop color advance synced to interactions (`[bg step 1]`→step 2→…) → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping, here applied to a background-color state rather than text)
- modal slide-up + in-modal typing as one combined beat → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel slide-in) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the in-modal typed text)
- element-scale fake zoom — the UI window scales, camera locked (static-stage tour) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (applied to the surface wrapper rather than the world)
- side detail panel slide-in from the right edge / hamburger→sidebar slide-open / hover popover drop → `card-morph-anchor` / `scale-swap-transition` (the panel arrival) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (which content each panel shows per beat)
- hard panel swap / in-panel content snapping through states / hover-triggered micro update / type-to-filter live-collapse / element identity swap on drop → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- table populates row-by-row / fill-handle auto-fill cascading down rows / log rows cascade in → `waterfall-entry`
- formula typed into a cell / character-by-character auto-typing with blinking caret / letter-by-letter typed name → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (the caret)
- node-graph build (cards + connecting lines radiate from center) → `center-outward-expansion` (the cards) + `svg-path-draw` (the connecting lines draw)
- click spawns a labeled toolbar / dropdown fills on click / drop-snap settle of the placed field / window scale-up with settle → `spring-pop-entrance`
- modal spring-up over a dimming document → `spring-pop-entrance` (the modal) + `depth-of-field-blur` (the document dim/blur beneath)
- ghost-chip drag-and-drop / cursor grab-drag of components between mockups / fill-handle drag / corner-handle resize drag → `cursor-drag` (`cursor-click-ripple` covers move+click only)
- floating inspector panel TRACKS the cursor, content snapping per element → `ai-tracking-box` (the per-frame follow mechanics, restyled as an inspector panel) + `dynamic-content-sequencing` (the per-element content)
- live cursive preview building per typed keystroke → `svg-path-draw` (progressive stroke reveal keyed to typing progress)
- continuous zoom-breathing single shot (drag-drop variant) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back / focus / push phases + micro-drift)
- motion-blur window fly-in / tight-crop open then zoom-out to full page → `motion-blur-streak` (the fly-in) + `viewport-change` (the zoom-out)
- multiple labeled collaborative cursors moving independently → `multi-cursor-choreography` (N labeled independent cursor actors; the single-actor cursor rules assume one)
- canvas-group translate-pan within a static frame → `viewport-change` (the `.world` translate realizes the pan; semantically the camera stays locked)
- headline builds word-group by word-group over the demo → `waterfall-entry`
- brand icon-ring end beat → `svg-path-draw` (the ring) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the lockup)
- 3D end-card float on the hold → `sine-wave-loop` — CAUTION: motion-doctrine bans idle wobble; prefer a settle-and-hold

**camera modifier**: The defining motion is the camera CHASE — the viewport follows the cursor from target to target via `camera-cursor-tracking` (primary), realized as concrete push-in + pan / whip-pan / pan-down moves under `viewport-change`, sequenced into discrete interaction beats by `multi-phase-camera`, with each beat's destination targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom to the acted-on region). Product_Intro biases toward a slow, exploratory pan + focus-pull that sweeps the surface; Key_Feature biases toward snappier whip-pans / progressive zoom that march through the workflow and lock static on the action button. This camera-servo-to-cursor is what separates the blueprint from hands-off camera scrolls (dataviz-scroll-reveal) and static device/window tours. The golden set widens this into a spectrum. At one pole the **static-stage state tour** (now the largest member set) LOCKS the camera for the entire clip and lets the UI itself do all the moving — panel slide-ins, element-scale fake zooms, content snaps — with the cursor alone carrying the eye. The **drag-drop** variant replaces discrete chase beats with ONE continuous zoom-breathing arc under `multi-phase-camera`. The **hover-inspect** variant inverts the push-in: a tight-crop open zooms OUT to the full page before the cursor sweep. Pick the pole per brief — chase for workflow marches, locked stage for dense reconstructed dashboards, a single breathe for one-document journeys. With the locked pole absorbed, what separates this blueprint from `device-surface-showcase` is the CURSOR-as-actor, not the camera: a fully static tour still belongs here as long as a visible cursor drives every state change.

## Selected motion rule: cursor-drag

---
name: cursor-drag
description: The drag verb for driven cursors — grab, lift, travel, drop-snap. A semi-transparent ghost chip rides the cursor in exact lockstep and snaps into a placed field with selection chrome; variants cover fill-handle auto-fill down rows, corner-handle proportional resize (uniform scale only), and grab-lift-reorder with the neighbor springing into the vacated slot.

# Cursor Drag

> Cursor look, sizing, off-screen entry, and tip-targeting defer to the **oversized-cursor house doctrine** — this rule owns the drag _mechanics_ only.

THE held-journey verb: the cursor presses down on a payload, carries it, and releases it somewhere else. The load-bearing law is **lockstep**: the cursor tip and the payload's grip point move as one rigid object for the entire travel — a one-frame drift reads as the chip slipping out of the hand. Distinct from [cursor-click-ripple.md](cursor-click-ripple.md) (move → point event at a single location): a drag is a _sustained hold across space_, and the payload is the co-star. Reuse [physics-press-reaction.md](physics-press-reaction.md) for the grab's press dip (cursor + payload compress together); for N simultaneous actors see [multi-cursor-choreography.md](multi-cursor-choreography.md) — this rule is one protagonist performing a workflow beat.

## How It Works

Five beats: **approach** (cursor glides to the source chip, `power2.inOut`) → **grab** (press dip on cursor + chip together; on the down-beat `tl.set` reveals the **ghost** — a pre-rendered semi-transparent clone at the chip's position — plus a small lift `fromTo` to `GHOST_LIFT_SCALE` with a soft shadow, `immediateRender: false`) → **travel** (cursor and ghost move as **matched tweens**) → **drop** (ghost off, placed field pops in with selection chrome) → **adjust / exit** (optional handle resize, then the cursor glides to the next target).

Matched tweens = same timeline position, same duration, same ease, over straight lines — that keeps the pair rigidly locked at every eased midpoint. A shared `[cursor, ghost]` targets array only works when both need identical deltas; with different start points, use two matched `fromTo`s. Rule-specific corollary of the contract's absolute-values law: a relative `+=` travel on either partner breaks the lockstep under seek.

Measure chip and slot rects at build time — a 4 px miss on the drop line reads as a failed drag (montage: authored CSS-matched constants, per the contract). `TIP_OFFSET_X/Y` aligns the cursor's TIP (not its bbox) with the grip point.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Ghost = clone of the chip AT the chip's position, in DOM from t=0, opacity: 0.
     Same silhouette as the chip — or hand and payload read as different objects.
     Placed field sits at the slot's final position, opacity: 0, with a .select-box
     and four corner .handle elements inside. -->
<div class="tray-chip" id="source-chip"><span class="grip-dots">⋮⋮</span> {chipLabel}</div>
<div class="drag-ghost" id="drag-ghost"><span class="grip-dots">⋮⋮</span> {chipLabel}</div>
<div class="placed-field" id="placed-field">
  {placedLabel}
  <!-- + selection chrome -->
</div>
<div class="cursor" id="cursor"><!-- arrow SVG --></div>
```

```js
const chipRect = document.querySelector("#source-chip").getBoundingClientRect();
const slotRect = document.querySelector("#placed-field").getBoundingClientRect();
const TRAVEL_DX = slotRect.left - chipRect.left;
const TRAVEL_DY = slotRect.top - chipRect.top;

// Travel — MATCHED tweens: same position, duration, ease; absolute endpoints.
tl.fromTo(
  "#drag-ghost",
  { x: 0, y: 0 },
  { x: TRAVEL_DX, y: TRAVEL_DY, duration: TRAVEL_DUR, ease: TRAVEL_EASE, immediateRender: false },
  TRAVEL_AT,
);
tl.fromTo(
  "#cursor",
  { x: chipRect.left + TIP_OFFSET_X, y: chipRect.top + TIP_OFFSET_Y },
  {
    x: chipRect.left + TIP_OFFSET_X + TRAVEL_DX,
    y: chipRect.top + TIP_OFFSET_Y + TRAVEL_DY,
    duration: TRAVEL_DUR,
    ease: TRAVEL_EASE,
    immediateRender: false,
  },
  TRAVEL_AT,
);

// Drop is a state commit: ghost off + placed field on at the SAME position.
tl.set("#drag-ghost", { opacity: 0 }, DROP_AT);
tl.fromTo(
  "#placed-field",
  { opacity: 0, scale: 0.92 },
  { opacity: 1, scale: 1, duration: SNAP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  DROP_AT,
);
tl.fromTo(
  [".select-box", ".handle"],
  { opacity: 0, scale: 0.6 },
  { opacity: 1, scale: 1, duration: 0.18, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.02 },
  DROP_AT + SNAP_DUR * 0.4,
);
```

## Variations

- **Corner-handle proportional resize** — width/height tweens are forbidden, so the resize renders as uniform `scale` with `transform-origin` at the **opposite (anchor) corner**: the anchor stays put, the dragged corner travels. The corner's position is _linear in scale_ (`corner = anchor + scale × (corner₀ − anchor)`), so a cursor tween to the corner's end position with the **same duration and ease** stays glued to the handle exactly:

  ```js
  tl.to(
    "#placed-field",
    { scale: RESIZE_SCALE, transformOrigin: "0% 0%", duration: RESIZE_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
    RESIZE_AT,
  );
  tl.to(
    "#cursor",
    { x: CORNER_END_X, y: CORNER_END_Y, duration: RESIZE_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
    RESIZE_AT,
  );
  ```

  One-axis resizes are `scaleX`/`scaleY` on the same origin logic — stretch-safe boxes only; route to [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md)'s counter-scale when content must stay undistorted.

- **Fill-handle auto-fill** — the spreadsheet verb: the cursor drags a cell's fill handle straight down on a `"none"` (linear) ease; each row commits via a snapped `tl.set` (never a fade) keyed to the handle's linear progress, so the fill edge and cursor never separate:

  ```js
  tl.fromTo(
    "#cursor",
    { y: HANDLE_Y },
    { y: HANDLE_Y + FILL_DIST, duration: FILL_DUR, ease: "none", immediateRender: false },
    FILL_AT,
  );
  gsap.utils.toArray(".fill-cell").forEach((cell, i) => {
    tl.set(cell, { opacity: 1 }, FILL_AT + ((i + 1) / CELL_COUNT) * FILL_DUR);
  });
  ```

- **Grab-lift-reorder** — lift = `y: -LIFT_RISE` + `rotation: LIFT_TILT` (sign from index parity) + shadow on; as the carried item crosses the neighbor's midpoint, the **neighbor springs into the vacated slot** (a `fromTo` translate at `TRAVEL_AT + TRAVEL_DUR * 0.5`, `power3.out`); drop = rotation → 0, shadow off, settle. The neighbor's counter-move sells the reorder — without it the list reads as broken.
- **Component grab between surfaces** — a chip dragged mockup-to-mockup, swapping identity on drop (`tl.set` recolor + label swap at `DROP_AT`, tiny settle pop); the drop chrome is just the identity swap, no handles.

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| approach / press            | per cursor-click-ripple                      | approach 0.4–1.0 s; press-dip halves 0.06–0.12 s; cursor compresses more than the payload                                      |
| GHOST_OPACITY               | 0.5–0.75                                     | below 0.5 vanishes on busy documents; ~1.0 reads as the original moving — then hide `#source-chip` at the grab                 |
| GHOST_LIFT_SCALE / LIFT_DUR | 1.03–1.08 / 0.12–0.2 s                       | the shadow is the "off the surface" cue; the scale is garnish                                                                  |
| TRAVEL_DUR / TRAVEL_EASE    | 0.6–1.2 s / `power2.inOut`                   | a considered drag decelerates into the slot; `power1.inOut` for a calmer carry. `TRAVEL_AT ≥ GRAB_AT + 2×PRESS_DUR + LIFT_DUR` |
| DROP_AT / SNAP_DUR          | `TRAVEL_AT + TRAVEL_DUR` exactly / 0.2–0.3 s | a gap between arrival and snap reads as the drop failing                                                                       |
| RESIZE_SCALE / RESIZE_DUR   | by story (≈0.4–0.6) / 0.6–1.0 s              | `power2.inOut`                                                                                                                 |
| LIFT_RISE / LIFT_TILT       | 6–12 px / 2–4°                               | reorder pickup; index-derived tilt sign                                                                                        |

## Critical Constraints

- **Lockstep is the law** — matched tweens over straight lines (or one shared tween when deltas are identical); verify at the eased midpoint, not just the endpoints. Absolute endpoints on both partners.
- **The ghost is pre-rendered** — a DOM clone at the source position from t=0, `opacity: 0`, revealed by `tl.set`; placed field and chrome likewise. Never cloned at runtime, never conditionally rendered.
- **Grab has weight** — press dip + lift shadow before any travel; a chip departing without a press reads as telekinesis.
- **Drop is a state commit** — ghost off and placed field on at the same timeline position, `DROP_AT = TRAVEL_AT + TRAVEL_DUR`.
- **Resizes are uniform `scale`, origin at the anchor corner** — never width/height; one-axis stretch on stretch-safe boxes only.
- **Linear ease on the fill-handle travel** — the evenly-spaced `tl.set` reveals depend on it; an eased handle bunches them at the ends.
- **One verb per beat** — drag, then resize, then exit; overlapping a travel with a resize turns choreography into mush.
- **`pointer-events: none`** on cursor, ghost, and chrome.
